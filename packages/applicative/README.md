## Description

This package includes type definition for `applicative` type class, which includes

- `unit<T>(value: T): Applicative<T>`
- `of: typeof unit`
- `ap<T, U>(this: Applicative<T>, wf: Applicative<Fun<[T], U>>): Applicative<U>`

(Above type definitions are not accurate one. In here, accurate types are modified for easier understanding.)
